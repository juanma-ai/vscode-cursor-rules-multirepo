An enhanced fork of [Custom Cursor Rules](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=beilunyang.cursor-rules) by [BeilunYang](https://github.com/beilunyang) with additional features for managing multiple cursor rule repositories.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This extension works with `.cursorrules` files

## New Features in this Fork

- Support for configurable repository sources via `cursorRules.repos` setting
  - Repository order in settings determines the order of rules in the Command Palette

```
"cursorRules.repos": [
    "https://github.com/juanma-ai/my-cursor-rules/tree/main/rules",
    "https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules/tree/main/rules",
    "https://github.com/tugkanboz/awesome-cursorrules/tree/main/rules"
  ]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Any repo added to `cursorRules.repos` must follow the same structure than https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules/tree/main/rules to organize the rules (e.g: `rules/appium-mobile-test-automation-framework/.cursorrules`)

- Source indicator in QuickPick UI showing which repository each rule comes from
- User prompt to choose between appending or overwriting .cursorrules file
- Enhanced error handling and typescript definitions

## Usage

- Open the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Cursor Rules Multirepo: Add .cursorrules".
