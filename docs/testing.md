# Testing Documentation

This document provides an overview of the testing infrastructure used in this VS Code extension.

## Overview of the `src/test` Folder

The `src/test` folder contains the testing infrastructure for this VS Code extension. It's organized into several key components that enable efficient and comprehensive testing of the extension's functionality.

## Main Configuration Files

### `mocha-setup.ts`

- Sets up the test environment before running tests
- Configures module mocking by overriding Node's `require` function
- Intercepts imports for `vscode` to provide a mock implementation
- Supports global mocks via a `__mocks__` object
- Sets `NODE_ENV` to "test"

### `runTest.ts`

- Responsible for executing the test suite
- Sets up paths to the extension and test files
- Runs tests within the configured environment

## Test Directories

### `mocks/`

- Contains mock implementations for external dependencies
- Has `vscode.ts` (152 lines) which provides a mock implementation of the VS Code API
- This allows tests to run without requiring an actual VS Code instance

### `unit/`

- Contains unit tests for individual components
- Has `extension.test.ts` for testing the main extension functionality
- Includes a `utils/` subdirectory containing tests for utility functions

### `suite/`

- Contains the test suite configuration
- Has `index.ts` (43 lines) which sets up and organizes test execution

## Testing Approach

This testing structure follows a common pattern for VS Code extensions:

- **Unit tests** for testing individual components in isolation
- A **test suite configuration** for organizing test execution
- **Mocks** to simulate VS Code APIs without needing a running instance

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you can use the following npm scripts (defined in package.json):

- `npm test` - Runs all tests
- `npm run unit-test` - Runs unit tests

## Test Framework

This project uses Mocha as the test framework and likely uses assertion libraries like Chai or standard Node.js assertions for test assertions.

## Unit Testing

This project employs a unit testing strategy that focuses on testing individual components in isolation:

### `src/test/mocks/vscode.ts` - For Unit Testing

The `vscode.ts` mock provides a simulated VS Code API environment for unit testing:

- Enables **fast execution** of tests without launching VS Code
- Creates **predictable test conditions** with controlled responses
- Allows testing of **isolated components** without external dependencies
- Provides implementations for VS Code-specific functionality:
  - Configuration settings (`workspace.getConfiguration()`)
  - UI components (`window.createQuickPick()`)
  - Command registration (`commands.registerCommand()`)
  - Extension context (`ExtensionContext`)
  - State management (`Memento` class)

### Why This Approach Is Effective

This unit testing approach follows testing best practices:

1. **Fast Feedback Loop**:

   - Quick test execution during development
   - Immediate feedback on code changes
   - No need to launch VS Code for testing

2. **Precise Testing**:

   - Tests specific code paths in isolation
   - Clear identification of failing components
   - Easy to maintain and update tests

3. **Portable Testing**:

   - Tests can run anywhere without special setup
   - No dependencies on VS Code installation
   - Consistent test environment across different machines

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - Tests business logic thoroughly
   - Validates individual function behavior
   - Ensures component reliability
